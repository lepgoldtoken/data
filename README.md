Introduction
  Decentralized Finance (De Fi)
  Decentralized finance (also known as DeFi) refers to an ecosystem of financial
applications built on blockchain networks and it is not controlled by any central authority.

  Decentralized finance is an open-source, transparent, and permissionless financial
service ecosystem that does not have a central entity.
  Individuals, startups, and institutions are now associating with DeFi because it brings
in decentralized exchanges to fix the failures of the traditional centralized financial system in
the financial ecosystem.

  Decentralize finance allows tokens holders to have full authority and control over their
digital assets and gives them the opportunity to interact with this ecosystem through peertopeer (P2P) decentralized networks.
The DeFi space is currently experienAcing an incredible surge.
  
  As of October 2020, a whopping $24.45 billion worth of cryptocurrency assets has been
locked into the DeFi ecosystem. This represents a 240% increase from the initial figures posted
in June 2020.

  Despite the enormous growth within a short period of time, the DeFi ecosystem is
relatively new and holds a lot of promise. Identifying the potential and the opportunities in
this market, Lepricon Gold Token will develop and promote great services that will benefit all
investors. 
  
Binance Smart Chain
  Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain protocol from Binance that runs in parallel
with Binance Chain.
  Unlike Binance Chain, however, Binance Smart Chain powers smart contract
functionality and boasts compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
BSC has one of the fastest blockchain transaction times and lowest fee structures,
which makes building DeFi apps on the protocol so appealing for developers.
  Binance Smart Chain uses a consensus algorithm known as Proof of Staked Authority
(PoSA) where 21 validators stake BNB, the native token for the Binance ecosystem, to secure
the network.
  Unlike many other blockchains, however, Binance Smart Chain does not offer block
subsidies or allows minting of fresh BNB in the form of a block reward. Instead, validators
receive transaction fees as a reward for securing the network.
Binance Smart Chain’s BEP-20 token uses essentially the same format as the Ethereum
protocol’s popular ERC-20 tokens.
Currently, there are already 60+ DApps operating on Binance Smart Chain, with the
majority focusing on decentralized finance solutions.
